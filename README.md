<h2 align="center"> Synchronization Software :arrows_counterclockwise: </h2>

A user-friendly software application that allows users to synchronize and share any kind of data across multiple devices and operating systems for increased productivity and efficiency.This will definitely help users with multiple devices along with those who don’t want to use different kinds of operating system environments.

In current days we can see around us that a lot of people can’t transfer data or information from Android to Windows or Windows to iOS; or iOS to Android and vice versa. It’s very difficult to share large amount of data just by using Google Drive or OneDrive or other cloud services. For this reason only, they might have to buy large sized portable drives. It’s not always a good idea because it might be only used once or it might weigh too much. 

So, we thought of a solution that will help us to transfer data despite it being large or small through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or USB devices. Then it will convert according to its needs and to combine all the environments equally. In that way we don’t have to buy the same operating system devices like a Mac for an iPhone.
